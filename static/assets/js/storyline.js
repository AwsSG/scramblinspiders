const frontDoor = "You run out of the front door, and in the fog, you can see something that looks like a lantern. It must be a lantern as it's bobbing left and right and moving in a direction you are not familiar with. It seems to be heading for that old house that was scheduled for demolishing, but it's still standing. The city council could do a better job of maintaining the town - you mumble to yourself. You decide to follow it as it's the only thing that can give you any clues. It's bloody cold outside and the fog isn't helping, so you take another coat from the rack in the pub. The others won't be using it. Probably. As you rush to catch up with the lantern, you yell to try and slow down whoever is holding it and eventually you get to the old house. You realise it's a bit dangerous to go in and decide to look around. The house isn't stable and your imagination is kicking into overdrive: vampires, werewolves, monsters... Naaah! This isn't a fairy-tale. Is it? After going behind the house you see a short...creature, coming out of the house. You get the chills down your spine, as if the fog and the cold aren't enough. You quickly hide and watch it as it's holding the lantern and going to:"
const backDoor = "You rush out of the back door, and in the fog, you can see something that looks like a lantern. It must be a lantern as it's bobbing left and right and moving in a direction you are not familiar with. It seems to be heading for that old castle. Is anyone even living there? - you ask yourself. I thought the council is only maintaining that old ruin with our money for tourism purposes. If there were any tourists at all. It's only collecting cobwebs, dust, rats and who knows what. You decide to follow it as it's the only thing that can give you any clues. It's bloody cold outside and the fog isn't helping, so you take another coat from the rack in the pub. The others won't be using it. Probably. As you rush to catch up with the lantern, you yell to try and slow down whoever is holding it but it's not stopping. Eventually you get to the old Castle. The castle isn't even stable and your imagination is starting to get the better of you: vampires, werewolves, monsters... Naaah! This isn't a fairy-tale. Is it? I've been through here hundreds of times during daylight... Daylight... I wish I had some right now, but I need to get out of this mess. As you are a sensible person, you decide to go around the castle to try and investigate a bit, but after going around the corner, you see a short...creature, coming out of the castle. You get the chills down your spine, like the fog and the cold aren't enough. You quickly hide and watch it as it's holding the lantern and going to:"
const barArea = "It might be something on the tv or radio - you think to yourself. I'll just go and shut it down because this might be part of their prank. As you go through the bar area to reach the remote and the radio, you hear the wooden floor creaking. Before you can react, the floor collapses and you fall into the darkness. After you fall, you lie down on the floor looking up seeing only a white spot that was the hole in the floor you fell through. You try to move, but your body doesn't respond! I must have broken my spine! But before you can yell for help, an unusually large hand covers your complete face like it was waiting for you. You feel sudden pain, moments before you lose consciousness and realise you"

const cemetery = "Was that...fur? Or a tentacle on its body? This fog is starting to play tricks on me. I'll follow it from a safe distance. I NEED to get to the bottom of this. Why isn't there anyone around??? Questions start racing in your mind. You decide to follow the light of the lantern from a safe distance without seeing the creature so it cannot see you. You hope. You again see lantern starting to climb up. It must be that cemetery that recently opened up on the hill. The chapel they erected on it sure was strange. Nobody could explain to me what religion that is, but that's probably the case with most modern churches and temples. The creature left the lantern on a pole in the middle of the cemetery, just in front of the chapel. What is...it up to? The lantern gave up a strong shine that blinded you and suddenly you hear howling, like somebody released hundreds of hounds in the distance. It was chaotic and it was getting closer. \"Where's the creature???\" - you ask yourself after rubbing your eyes. You still haven't regained your vision completely when something brushed your shoulder and knocked you to the ground. Shocked, you think it's best to get out of the open and, no matter how illogical it sounds, follow the creature - just to get out of here! You suddenly spot it, with what little vision you have left, heading to the:"
const forest = "Was that...fur? Or a tentacle on its body? This fog is starting to play tricks on me. I'll follow it from a safe distance. I NEED to get to the bottom of this. Why isn't there anyone around??? Questions start racing in your mind. You decide to follow the light of the lantern from a safe distance without seeing the creature so it cannot see you. You hope... You again see lantern starting to climb up. \"I'm not going into a forest!\" - you think to your self before realising it was repurposed as a park recently. They brought in some weird looking people to survey the area, and the engineers weren't far from odd. It made for an odd park with those weird looking playground things. It's a miracle it passed the inspection with all those pointy poles and weird materials. One would think a spongy material like that couldn't hold the whole swing set, but you've seen stranger things. It looked like the fog is retreating as the creature nears the playground in the middle. It starts digging, looking for something and suddenly a pole starts coming out of the ground. The creature leaves the lantern on the pole and as soon as it is hanging, a loud shriek fills the air making you temporarily deaf. Fog, cold, weird stuff in the dark and now... You don't even get to finish your thought, as something dark starts emerging from the ground. Corpses of people, dead long ago, start rising! You decide this is no longer a place for you. Looking around, you realise that a thick cover of darkness has covered everything outside of the park and, no matter how illogical it sounds, it would be better to follow the creature. You manage to collect your thoughts just enough to see the creature heading towards the:"
const cave = "Was that...fur? Or a tentacle on its body? This fog is starting to play tricks on me. I'll follow it from a safe distance. I NEED to get to the bottom of this. Why isn't there anyone around??? You decide to follow just the light of the lantern from a distance without seeing the creature so it can't see you. You hope. Suddenly, light becomes dimmer and it looks like it entered a cave. You move closer to investigate, but you feel like some...thing has hit you on the head. Last thing you can see is a werewolf dragging you into the cave as you lose your consciousness and realise you are dead."

const church = "You rush into the church, slamming the door behind you. You make sure whatever is outside can't get in. You get the benches, statues, and whatever else you can find and bar them against the door. Out of breath, you look at the door hoping it will hold. But you forgot about the creature... You slowly turn around to see it pointing at the bright light at the altar. It couldn't approach and it looked like it was trying to destroy it. \"If it is trying to destroy it, it must be good for me\" - you think. You hesitate whether to run and destroy it or grab it and throw it at the creature. While deciding what to do, you realise that the pictures on the wall are different than the ones in any other light. They are depicting a story about a curse of the creatures ancestors: When the first people appeared on Earth, there was chaos, and the creatures flourished from it. Humans managed to harness the light through fire and drove the creatures away into the underground. Light wasn't very kind to them as it burned their skin and killed them slowly. Since that day, every Halloween, a creature emerges from the underground, grabs a weakened light, which is the lantern, and tries to destroy the light by powering the chaos it can fuel with the weakened light's energy. This is the only time in the year when the true light is weakened but it's still too strong for many creatures to go through this ritual so they send only one, in hope that the chaos can overwhelm the one true light. Realising this, you decide to:"
const hospital = "You rush into the hospital, slamming the door behind you. You make sure whatever is outside can't get in. You get the benches, statues, and whatever else you can find and bar it against the door. Out of breath, you look at the door hoping it will hold. But you forgot about the creature... You slowly turn around to see it pointing at the bright light in the middle of the large waiting room. It couldn't approach and it looked like it was trying to destroy it. \"If it is trying to destroy it, it must be good for me\" - you think. You rush to the bright light trying to throw it at the creature, but as soon as you touch it, it overwhelms you showing you visions of the world long past: When the first people appeared on Earth, there was chaos, and the creatures flourished from it. Humans managed to harness the light through fire and drove the creatures away into the underground. Light wasn't very kind to them as it burned their skin and killed them slowly. Since that day, every Halloween, a creature emerges from the underground, grabs a weakened light, which is the lantern, and tries to destroy the light by powering the chaos it can fuel with the weakened light's energy.

Seeing all this, you decide to:"
const dontFollow = "\"I've had enough! All of this doesn't make sense! I must be sleeping or something!\" - you think to yourself as the undead are approaching your location. You refuse to participate and you just sit on the ground, with your senses impaired, hoping that this is all just a dream. You were wrong... The undead overwhelm you and the last thing you feel is pain as you lose consciousness and die. Congratulations! You've got so close to the solution. Why not try it again? Try out different choices to discover what's it all about."

/* Fourth choice points */
const destroyCreature = "As you pull yourself together, you know the right thing to do is to kill the creature. You grab the closest metal bar and hit the creature. Weakened by the light, the creature falls back a couple of footsteps, releases a high pitched shriek and dies. Its body starts to decompose right before your eyes before you can get a good look at it. At that moment, light from the light source starts to overwhelm the space. It blinds you making you disoriented. Not even your eyelids are helping as you receive another vision: Another creature made entirely out of light, considerably bigger than the one you were chasing, thanks you for protecting the light for another cycle. As it pulls away in something that could only be described as light at the end of a tunnel, you find yourself back where you started from. Space around you is filled with morning light, you feel completely refreshed like something has recharged your batteries. There's a queue of people waiting to get inside who were surprised by your presence, but nobody is paying too much attention. What a world we live in. \"That was some night\" you say to yourself. \"I only need to find out if it was all true or if it was just a drunken fantasy.\" Never mind - even if you tell it to someone, no one would believe you. Some psychiatrists might be interested, but that's about it. You dust yourself and go home to your family."
const nothing = "As you pull yourself together, you realise that this has to be some kind of a dream, or a hallucination - it has to be. You grab your head, kneel on the floor and with closed eyes release the loudest shout you could. At that moment, the clock strikes midnight and the light starts to overwhelm the space. It blinds you making you disoriented. Not even your eyelids are helping as you pass out. The creature's window to destroy the light has passed, and the light is back to its full strength. You awake up feeling good like never before, like something has recharged your batteries. No trace of the creature or the light. There's a wonderful morning outside and the maintenance guy is calling the security. \"That was some night\" you say to yourself. \"I only need to find out if it was all true or if I was just blindly drunk.\" Nevermind - even if it was true, no one would believe your story. You stand up and go home to your family."
const destroyLight = "After all you've been through, you decide to help the creature. For reasons known only to you, you grab a big metal bar and start smashing the light. It works, but not completely. The creature points at the bowl with water and then at the light. You take the bowl and splash it on the light. The creature encourages you to keep smashing the light as it starts emitting a very loud and worrying noise. As the light becomes dimmer and dimmer, you see how impenetrable darkness, almost like a dark fog, is starting to overwhelm the space outside and starting to overflow the building. All those things at the door couldn't stop it. You realise you've made a mistake. Dark, thick, cold fog is starting to envelop you. You see a spot of light just before everything becomes cold and dark.... Congratulations! You've got to one of the endings. Why not try another one?"
